    <p>
        1. Is there a form that I need to fill before entering the SSN office?
<br />        Answer: Yes. For the process to be over quickly, please fill this form before going to the SSN office: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/request-number-first-time
</br>
</br>
        2. What document do I need to give for my address proof?
<br />        Answer: You can take your lease agreement document if it has your name on it. If not, you can take a printout of your bank account details that clearly mention an address. Alternatively, you can also take your Wi-Fi and Electricity bills. Keep in mind that they just need an address to mail your SSN card. That's why they need a proper proof of your address.
