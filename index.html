    <h2>
        1. Is there a form that I need to fill before entering the SSN office?
        Answer: Yes. For the process to be over quickly, please fill this form before going to the SSN office: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/request-number-first-time

        2. What document do I need to give for my address proof?
        Answer: You can take your lease agreement document if it has your name on it. If not, you can take a printout of your bank account details that clearly mention an address. Alternatively, you can also take your Wi-Fi and Electricity bills. Keep in mind that they just need an address to mail your SSN card. That's why they need a proper proof of your address.

        3. What if I don't have the I-94 with me?
        Answer: It's completely alright if you don't have your I-94. You can go this link - https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home - and download your most recent I-94.
        
        4. Should I take a photocopy of my passport, or should I carry the original?
        Answer: You need to carry your original passport.

        5. Where can I go to apply for my SSN?

        6. How long does it take to receive my SSN?
        Answer: It usually takes 5-8 days to receive it. You'll receive it in your mail's inbox.

        7. Can I start my employment without getting the SSN card?
        Answer: Yes. If you've visited the SSN office and have submitted your documents, you can start your employment with the SSN receipt.
